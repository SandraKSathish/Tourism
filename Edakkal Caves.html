                        <p>Twenty five kilometers away from Kalpetta lays two caves which showcases nature’s skill and
                            philosophy on architecture. These caves are located 1,200 m above the sea level on Ambukutty
                            Mala. The name ‘Edakkal’ literally means ‘a stone in between’. Here you can see a cave
                            formed by a heavy boulder straddling a fissure in the rock.<br><br>

                            Many legends are there behind the formation of Edakkal caves. One of the stories is that,
                            these caves are said to be formed with the arrows fired by Lava and Kusha, the sons of Lord
                            Sri Rama. Another one is associated with Kutti Chathan and the Goddess Mudiampilly. The
                            local people used to have a pilgrimage trip to this place to honour the Goddess.

                        </p><br>
                        <p>The caves were discovered by Fred Fawcett, the then Superintendent of Police of the Malabar
                            district in 1890, during his hunting trip to Wayanad. He discovered the Edakkal
                            rock-shelter, situated on the western side of Edakkalmala. To his surprise, he identified
                            the place as a habitat of Neolothic people.<br><br>

                            Edakkal caves are famous for its pictorial paintings (cave paintings), which are considered
                            to be of 6000 B C. To reach the caves, one has to trek through the Ambukutty Mala. It will
                            take around 45 minutes to climb the hill and you will never get disappointed in your trip to
                            these historic caves.

                            carvings of human, animal figures and objects used by humans, on the walls of the caves.

                A 4-night 5-day trip is recommended for family tours. Members of family tours love to spend time in Kerala houseboats in Alleppey, Munnar tea gardens, boat safari and animal spotting at Thekkady and shopping at Lulu Mall in Cochin. You can also buy banana chips that the state is famous for, tea from Munnar, spices from Thekkady and Kerala sarees from handicraft stores.

                An overnight stay in a Kerala houseboat is recommended over just a day trip. A 1-night stay in an authentic houseboat with your loved ones will give you a chance to explore the beautiful backwaters of Kerala under the stars. A personal chef will treat you to local fish curry and Kerala meals right on the boat. Combine the houseboat stay with a trip to Munnar’s endless rows of tea gardens and at a nature resort in the heart of Thekkady.

     ♦ Kovalam - Beach (if staying for more than one night, a day trip to Kanyakumari which is the tip of India is also recommended)<br>
