                  <p class="">Located in the southwestern tip of India, Thiruvananthapuram is bound by the Arabian Sea in the west and Tamil Nadu in the east. Named after Anantha Padmanabha or Lord Vishnu, the city is home to many ancient temples. But the landmark is the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple around which the city has been built on seven low hills. The wooded highlands of the Western Ghats in the eastern and northeastern borders give Thiruvananthapuram some of the most enchanting picnic spots. A long shoreline with internationally renowned beaches, historic monuments, backwater stretches and a rich cultural heritage make this district a much sought-after tourist destination. Clean and green, Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala is one of the most beautiful cities in the country.</p>

                  <p class="">One of the premier trade capitals of the Old World, Kollam is the centre of the country’s cashew trading and processing industry. Extolled by Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta in glowing terms, this was once a famous port of international spice trade. This historic town is home to the celebrated Ashtamudi Lake, making it a gateway to the breath-taking backwaters of Kerala. The eight-hour boat trip between Kollam and Alappuzha is the longest and most enchanting experience on the backwaters of Kerala. The momentous decision to introduce a new Malayalam era was convened at Kollam and hence the Malayalam calendar came to be known as kollavarsham.</p>

The pass acts as a corridor between Kerala and the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and played a key role in the trade relations between the east and west coasts of peninsular India. Deriving its name from the Malayalam words Pala (Alsteriascholaris) and Kadu (forest), this place was once a stunning expanse of forest covered with the sweet-scented flowers of the Pala tree. A potpourri of Tamil and Kerala culture, some of the finest Carnatic musicians hail from this district which continues to be a principally agrarian society.</p>

                An overnight stay in a Kerala houseboat is recommended over just a day trip. A 1-night stay in an authentic houseboat with your loved ones will give you a chance to explore the beautiful backwaters of Kerala under the stars.

Combine the houseboat stay with a trip to Munnar’s endless rows of tea gardens and at a nature resort in the heart of Thekkady.
